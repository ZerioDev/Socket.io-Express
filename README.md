### üë∂ Simple project

This is a small project that has been designed to be usable by everyone.

The objective of this project is to edit the data of a web page.

In this example, I chose to refresh this data every second :

- The last uptime
- A random number

The strong features of the method used :

- Updates without reloading the page
- Even after a restart or an interruption the data will be updated on restart
